These are competition-winning programs unchanged from the date of their creation in 2012, and may not reflect on my current style/methods of programming.

Palindrome takes in a user's string as input and tells the user whether that string is palindromic.

Two-player puzzle is a game where two players compete to reduce the size of a value without being the last to take from it.
